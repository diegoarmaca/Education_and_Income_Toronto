	•	College, CEGEP or other non-university certificate or diploma

	•	Not visible minority

First Graph (bar chart)
1. Get the neighbourhood with the highest household income -> A
2. Get the neighbourhood with the lowest household income -> B
3. Get the average household income of Toronto
4. Bar chart that compares the income of the A, B and Toronto average

Second Graph (Stacked bar chart)
1. Shape the dataset to have the following three columns: 
	•	No certificate, diploma or degree, 
	•	College, CEGEP or other non-university certificate or diploma, 
	•	University certificate or diploma below bachelor level

2. Get the values of A and B in the three columns, turn the in percentage
3. Calculate the Toronto average of the three columns, turn them in percentage
4. Compare the percentage of A, B and Toronto Average
